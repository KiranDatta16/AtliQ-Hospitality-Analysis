Problem Statement:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

Task:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are a data analyst who has been provided with sample data and a mock-up dashboard to work on the following task. You can download all relevant documents from the download section.
1. Create the metrics according to the metric list.
2. Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
3. Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.

Key Metrics:
---------------------------------------------------------------
1. Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR): Represents the revenue generated per available room, regardless of occupancy status.
2. RevPAR helps hotels gauge their revenue-generating performance for accurate room pricing and comparison with competitors.
3. Daily Sellable Room Nights (DSRN): Indicates the average number of rooms available for sale on a given day within a specific timeframe.
4. Average Daily Rate (ADR): The ratio of total revenue to the total number of rooms booked/sold. It reflects the average price paid for rooms sold during a specific period.
5. Daily Booked Room Nights (DBRN): Indicates the average number of rooms booked per day within a specific timeframe.

Dashboards:
-------------------------
1.Sales View:
-----------------------------
The Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of several key performance metrics like Revenue Trends, Booking platforms, Occupancy % across different cities,Average ratings and operational metrics

2.Key Metrics Overview:
------------------------------------------
This dashboard is presenting key performance metrics and trends.This comprehensive view allows stakeholders to quickly assess the business's health and make informed decisions based on the data presented.

3.Property Metrics:
------------------------------
This dashbord plots various properties with metrics such as RevPAR, Occupancy Percentage, ADR, Revenue, Realisation Percentage, Average Rating, DSRN, DURN (Daily Utilized Room Nights), and Cancellations Percentage.

4.Cancellation View:
---------------------------------
The dashboard is inferring patterns and trends in cancellations, highlighting which platforms, properties, and room classes experience the most cancellations. This can help in identifying areas for improvement, such as customer service, pricing strategies, or promotional efforts, to reduce cancellation rates and improve overall performance.

INSIGHTS:
-----------------------
1. Direct offline platform have the fewest cancellations at 1,660 and the variation in cancellation rates between highly rated and low-rated properties is minimal(+/- 2%). 
So, AtliQ Grands should engage with transparent and reliable platforms that prioritize customer satisfaction.
3. Mumbai city leads in cancellations with 10,750. AtliQ Grands management should re-strategize their approach specifically for this market.
4. The disparity in RevPAR between weekdays and weekends is primarily driven by significant differences in occupancy rates. This suggests a lack of a dynamic pricing strategy to optimize revenue in response to varying demand.
